# Capacitated-Arc-Routing
This is SUSTech AI lab about Capacitated Arc Routing Problem

This project is how to solve and optimize the CARP
problem within a limited time. In this project, this type of
carp problem is a vehicle routing problem with capacity
limitations. The purpose of this project is to solve the
problem of several arc-based tasks for known needs, to find
out how to plan the vehicle route under the condition of
meeting the vehicle capacity constraints, so that the service
cost is minimum. The CARP problem is proposed by
Golden. And the problem has been proven to be an NP
problem[1]. For this problem, there are two algorithmic
approaches, one is the precise algorithm for small-scale
CARP problems, and the other is for large-scale CARP
problem heuristics, such as simulated annealing, evolutionary computation, and Tubu-scatter algorithm. In
this project, I will use the path-scanning greedy algorithm
and genetic algorithm to get the initial solution and optimize
the algorithm respectively.
